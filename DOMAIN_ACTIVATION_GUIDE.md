# 🌐 iRozQ8.com Domain Activation - Step by Step Guide

**Status**: ✅ Code pushed to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploying

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

Your iRozQ8 platform code is now **live on Vercel** and will update automatically every time you push to GitHub. Now you just need to connect your domain `irozq8.com`.

---

## 📋 Step 1: Get Nameservers from Vercel

Your Vercel nameservers are:
```
ns1.vercel-dns.com
ns2.vercel-dns.com
```

---

## 📋 Step 2: Update GoDaddy Nameservers

1. **Go to GoDaddy**: https://godaddy.com
2. **Login** with your account
3. **Find "irozq8.com"** in your domains list
4. **Click on it** to open settings
5. **Look for "Nameservers"** or **"DNS Settings"**
6. **Replace with Vercel nameservers**:
   - `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
   - `ns2.vercel-dns.com`
7. **Save changes**

---

## ⏳ Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation

**Time needed**: 24-48 hours (sometimes faster)

During this time:
- DNS records propagate globally
- Your domain gradually points to Vercel
- After propagation completes → Your site is live at `irozq8.com`

---

## ✅ Step 4: Verify Domain is Live

**After 24-48 hours:**

1. Open browser
2. Go to: `https://irozq8.com`
3. You should see your iRozQ8 gaming platform! 🎉
